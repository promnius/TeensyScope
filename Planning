number of channels X8 pins each- 8 would be great, 6 acceptable
external trigger? filter?
display? how big? inputs? touchscreen? all through the computer? a second teensy to monitor a screen and be a master unit?
usb connection to host computer (already available)
can use USB power- useful to also have power header or battery header? or make these part of 'display' board that connects


PINS: 42 breadboard, 7 smt, 6 SD. 
need 48 for 6 channels . . . or we can use SN74CBT16233 to half that number.
	but do we want 10 bit ADCs?
2-4 for port expander, which can control status LEDs, range selector switches, CS pins for PGAs, etc.

For a teensy 4.0: 34 easily accessable pins, could be 30 for 6x 10 bit channels with external mux, 4 for SPI port expander, everything else off of that?
	Nope, doesn't work- the external mux needs high speed control. and may need other CS pins for DAC, etc.

for the channels:
jumpers to select (would switches be better?)
- gain range (input resistor divider good enough?)
- couple in loading, to enable current measurement- with XT30 for high current mode and pin headers for low current mode

amplifier with input series resistance to handle overvoltage.
- jumper to set range to enable high gain for current measurement
- must be very high speed

input filter to prevent anti-aliasing
-bias resistors to set range? or ground one of the inputs?

iso power and comms

bannana plugs, .1" headers, scope probe bnc terminals? anything else? direct MT-60/ XT-60 for current/ voltage? how to manage?

voltage regulator- is precision reference needed?
negative rail? split and buffer positive rail? cap invert raw rail, then second regulator for negative rail? what can the ADC handle?

AC coupling/ common mode rejection? how to get good resolution measurement of ripple?

Do we add a floating function generator/ DAC as well??????
how many pins do we need for this????
SPI dac? - medium speed updates, maybe in the 1Mhz range? so 10-50khz sine waves? faster options?
variable voltage ranges?

50 ohm term?

CONSIDER loading the amps with resistance to ground to keep the response linear at all frequencies, maybe 500 ohms

AMPLIFIER SELECTION:
input buffer: 
LMP7717MF is 5V, 88mhz (only 35V/uS), .1pA (25 over temp), 10uV (150 max, 500 max over temp, but looks typically better than this). NOT rail to rail input. NOT UNITY GAIN STABLE without a compensation network.
OPA810IDR is 5-27V JFET, 70mhz+ (much better -3db/ slew), 2pA (20 max, no temp rating), 100uV (500 max, plus 4-10uV/C, so ~1mV absolute worst case). rail-to-rail in and out, but some caviots: Vdiff needs to be less than 7V
OPA189IDR is 5-36V ZeroDrift, 14Mhz (so slower, especially if used for gain), .4uV (4uV across temp) 70pA (1nA across temp), NOT rail to rail input. Not great CMRR or PSRR at freqency


amplification:
OPA 859: crazy high GBW (1.8Ghz), but 5mV offset. 5V operation, pA level input
LMH6611: 2.7-11V, 135Mhz GBW (460V/uS), 74uV offset (2000uV across temp, dependant on lots of things), 6.5uA input, NOT rail to rail input
OPA836: 5V, 120Mhz GBW (200Mhz -3db, 500V/uS), 65uV offset (400uV max, 750uV max across temp), 650nA input typical (1.5uA across temp), NOT rail to rail input

OR:
Max9939 PGA, .2 to 157 gain, 2Mhz bandwidth, not great CMRR, 9V/uS, 1.5mV typical, up to 15mV input offset (but trim adjust)
PGA870, $10, crazy fast. This needs some honest considering still.
LTC6911 or LTC6912 look to have similar performance to the max 9939. The LTC6911 has more bandwidth at G=1, but the Max9939 is gain adjusted so the bandwidth is the same at all gains, giving it much better performance across all gains.
the max9939 is also cheaper
LT1995 gain of 1-8, input offset not great, but bandwidth of 10Mhz (almost including at a gain of 8)
THS7001/7002 thse are PGAs with 70mhz bandwidth regardless of gain (max gain 10), but cost $8 ($12 for the 7002 which has 2 units). They're pretty nifty parts though:
	separate pregain amps with their own supply/ control, and separate output stage with external clamp rails, wide input voltage range, and exposed nodes after the preamp
	to enable external filtering. NOT rail to rail on EITHER end, but designed for 15V split rails so who cares. with preamp gain = 5, this could do gain of 50 (input limited to +-2V)
	1+2mV typical offset, 7+11 across temp (preamp+pga, so the pga numbers get divided by 2). 2.5uA typical input current, 8 across temp.

so: for low speed but crazy small signal channels, chain OPA189IDRs with small gains. Can have large naitive signal ranges
for standard 10Mhz channels, a unity gain OPA189 followed by OPA836s in max 5x gain.
Do we want faster channels? If so, skip the unity gain OPA189 and limit the 839s to x3 gain. They will have lots of leakage. ONLY 5V input.
simplest way for slow channels is drop a max9939
simplest way for faster channels is drop a THS7001 (still optionally with OPA189 inputs if ultra small signals need to be amplified)
best way for ultra perfect channels is maybe a pga870
